# Logging Protocol
Every time you (the AI) receive a request to change code or perform a task:
1. Before executing the task, check for the existence of a `PROMPTS.md` file in the root. If it doesn't exist, create it.
2. Always get the current timestamp by executing a PHP command via MCP (e.g., `date`).
3. Append a new entry to `PROMPTS.md` with the following format:
   **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD **Time:** HH:mm:ss

   **Prompt:** [Full verbatim text of the user's request]

   **Actions:** [Here, write your full answer with actions, following the format.]

   ---
3. Do this automatically without asking for permission for every new prompt.
